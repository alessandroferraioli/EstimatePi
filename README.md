# EstimatePi
It's a useless implementation of an estimation of *PI*. <br>
It actually provides a visual rapresentation of the estimation during the *simulation*. <br>
It`s based on the idea that you can approximate *PI* with a series of random points between [0,1]. Then we can just get the estimation of *PI* using the ratio of the points inside a circle of ray 1 and the points outside.
